# 🌐 NGINX Reverse Proxy Setup

This repository demonstrates how to set up an NGINX reverse proxy from scratch. The setup includes:

- Basic HTTP → HTTPS redirection
- Routing traffic to backend services
- Load balancing
- SSL termination with self-signed certificates
- (Optional) Docker-based deployment
